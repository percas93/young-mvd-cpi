# Young MVD CPI — Young Adult Cost of Living Index for Montevideo

## Project Description

**Young MVD CPI** is a data-driven dashboard that models the cost of living for young adults in Montevideo, Uruguay. Inspired by the methodology behind traditional Consumer Price Indexes (CPI), this project tailors its focus to reflect the consumption patterns and lifestyle of urban youth. The objective is to provide a monthly-updated, transparent, and locally relevant reference for personal budgeting, policy analysis, and economic research.

Rather than relying on user income data, the dashboard presents a curated "Young Adult Basket" of goods and services—covering essentials like rent, food, transport, leisure, and tech—weighted to approximate typical youth spending priorities. The project uses official microdata (e.g., ECH/ENIGH surveys) where possible, and supplements with publicly available prices to simulate historical and ongoing trends.

## Purpose

To provide a clear, updated cost of living index for young adults in Montevideo, useful for:

- Individuals budgeting or deciding whether they can “make it” in the city  
- Policymakers or researchers focused on urban youth economics  
- Third-party organizations or startups using this as a reference or tool
